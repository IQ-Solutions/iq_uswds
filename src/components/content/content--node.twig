  <h3>Status of the FY 2022 Budget
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>On March 28, 2022, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/">President&rsquo;s Budget</a> was released. This budget was developed relative to the continuing resolutions that extended into March 2022. It was not developed relative to the final FY 2022 appropriations that were passed on March 15, 2022 (see below).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The President&rsquo;s Budget calls for $49 billion in discretionary funding for NIH, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed into law <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2471">H.R. 2471</a>, <em>the Consolidated Appropriations Act</em>, <em>2022</em>, which provides FY 2022 appropriations to federal agencies. Among other provisions, the bill:
      <ul>
        <li>Provides $4.2 billion for NIA, including an additional $289 million above the FY 2021 enacted level for AD/ADRD research.</li>
        <li>Renames The Center for Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Related Dementias Building (Building T&ndash;44) to honor Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO), who is retiring at the end of this Congress.</li>
        <li>Provides $1 billion to fund the Advanced Research Projects Authority for Health (ARPA-H) within the HHS Office of the Secretary, though Congress has yet to pass authorizing language for ARPA-H. HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra subsequently provided formal notification to Congress that these funds would be transferred to NIH to establish ARPA-H.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>On March 11, 2022, President Biden signed into law <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-joint-resolution/75">H.J. Res. 75</a>, a continuing resolution which extended FY 2021 funding through March 15, 2022. An earlier set of continuing resolutions, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/6119/actions">H.R. 6119</a> and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/6617">H.R. 6617</a>, extended FY 2021 funding through February 18, 2022, and March 11, 2022, respectively.</li>

  <h2>An NIH-wide initiative (H2 Element)
  </h2>
  <p>Drs. Felipe Sierra and Ronald Kohanski, director and deputy director, respectively, of NIA&#39;s
    <a href="/research/dab">Division of Aging Biology</a>, were a moving force behind the establishment of the
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us">Trans-NIH Geroscience Interest Group (GSIG)(EXTL)</a>
    in 2012. The goal of the group is to stimulate interest and involvement in the basic science of aging across Institutes, Centers, and Offices at NIH. The group, which now includes 21 of NIH&#39;s 27 Institutes and Centers, hosts three seminars on the NIH campus each year and convenes workshops and summits on topics of interest to the geroscience community on a regular basis.
